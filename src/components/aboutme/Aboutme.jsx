              <p><span>Welcome to my Portfolio!</span> <br/><br/> Ever since building my first computer, I have been fascinated with everything IT-related such as hardware, software, and the development of everything inbetween! My main interests are Cyber Security and Software Engineering.<br></br><br/>
                I started my journey in 2016 when I went to college for IT, at the same time I started coding daily and learning to drive. I also got my first job at 17 as I have always wanted to improve and learn. <br/><br/> I attended The University of Essex and obtained my BSc in Computer Science with a Placement year graduating in 2023. During my time at University, I accomplished so much and learnt even more such as A.I., Networking, Software Development, Databases, Programming in multiple languages, and much more! I look forward to developing my skills and knowledge even more in the future. <br /><br />
                While finishing University I started full-time work at Awin as a Global Integration Analyst where I continue to improve my skills today.</p>
